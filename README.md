## Project Goals:

- Determine why Pitcher 1 struggled after the all-star break.
- Determine why Pitchers 2 and 3 improved after the all-star break.

## Summary of Data:

The data for this study contains all pitches that were taken by a batter (i.e., ball or called strike) when thrown by one of three pitchers. Pitcherâ€™s 1, 2, and 3 are all considered elite, high-value players across the league. In the 2019 season, Pitcher 1 had an earned run average (ERA) of 2.30 before the all-star break, followed by an ERA of 4.80 after the all-star break. Pitchers 2 and 3 posted ERA's of 3.10 and 3.30, respectively, before the all-star break. After the all-star break, Pitchers 2 and 3 posted ERA's of 1.80 and 1.44 respectively. This data was used to provide exploratory data analysis for all three pitchers and provide initial findings for the project goals listed above.
