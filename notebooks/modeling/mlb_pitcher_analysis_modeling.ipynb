    "\n",
    "The data for this study contains all pitches that were taken by a batter (i.e., ball or called strike) when thrown by one of three pitchers. Pitcherâ€™s 1, 2, and 3 are all considered elite, high-value players across the league. In the 2019 season, Pitcher 1 had an earned run average (ERA) of 2.30 before the all-star break, followed by an ERA of 4.80 after the all-star break. Pitchers 2 and 3 posted ERA's of 3.10 and 3.30, respectively, before the all-star break. After the all-star break, Pitchers 2 and 3 posted ERA's of 1.80 and 1.44 respectively. This data was used to provide exploratory data analysis for all three pitchers and provide initial findings for the project goals listed above. The initial findings were used as a guide to build a predictive model of called strikes for each pitcher. Called strikes was identified as the response variable that could lead to improved pitching performance over the course of the baseball season (without the use of hit, strikeout, or walk data)."

In our model, false positives are worse than false negatives, as we donâ€™t want to inform a player that they will get drafted and then they actually donâ€™t.

The 40-Yard Dash shows strong predictive power in that a good performance in this drill can actually help boost a lineman's draft status, while a bad performance in this drill can actually hurt a player's draft status. The second most important drill is the 3-Cone Drill. Similarly to the 40-Yard Dash, a good performance in this drill can slightly improve a player's draft status, while a bad performance can slightly harm a player's draft_status. It is also notable that players who skipped the 3-Cone Drill entirely had a higher draft status.

    "- The NFL Combine proves that strong athleticism can solely get a player drafted.\n",
    "- From a team's perspective, excluding a player's college statistics, teams display a high willingness to take a chance on a player who performs well in the NFL Combine.\n",
    "- From a player's perspective, if a player is lacking a strong volume of college statistics, the NFL Combine offers them a big opportunity to get drafted. The NFL Combine matters enough that if a player performs well in the event, it is likely to get that player drafted.\n",
    "- From an agent or draft evaluator's perspective, precision is our preferred metric when offering a player a projection on his potential draft status. In our model, false positives are worse than false negatives, as we donâ€™t want to inform a player that they will get drafted and then they actually donâ€™t. We want to be conservative and very sure in our recommendations to players. We want to avoid offering incorrect projections as much as possible.\n",
    "- The drill that has the most impact on a lineman's draft status is by far the 40-Yard Dash. The 40-Yard Dash shows strong predictive power in that a good performance in this drill can actually help boost a lineman's draft status, while a bad performance in this drill can actually hurt a player's draft status. The second most important drill is the 3-Cone Drill. Similarly to the 40-Yard Dash, a good performance in this drill can slightly improve a player's draft status, while a bad performance can slightly harm a player's draft_status. It is also notable that players who skipped the 3-Cone Drill entirely had a higher draft status. We suspect that this is the case because most of the time, the players who skip this drill are already highly likely to be drafted. "
